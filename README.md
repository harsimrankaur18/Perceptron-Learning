# Perceptron-Learning

"main.py" includes the code to implement a simple perceptron algorithm ona spambase dataset avialble on UCI: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/support/spambase

The model tries to classify emails as spam or not spam (binary classification). The algorithm helps to analze that the perceptron algorithm converges after a finite number of steps. The  graph depicts that the number of mistakes encountered by the model decreases with each pass of training data.
